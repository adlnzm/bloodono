# Blood-Connect

**Bridging Lives Through Blood Donation**

Blood-Connect is a web-based application built with **Streamlit** and **MySQL** that simplifies the process of managing and connecting **blood donors, receivers**, and **hospitals**. The app provides a centralized platform for users to register, search, and manage life-saving blood donation operations efficiently.

## Features

* **Donor Management** – Register new donors, view donor lists, and delete entries.
* **Receiver Management** – Add patients in need of blood, view and delete records.
* **Hospital Registry** – Register hospitals, view existing ones, or remove them.
* **Smart Search** – Search for blood donors by blood group and city.
* **Blood Compatibility Matching** – Built-in logic to identify compatible donors.
* **User-Friendly UI** – Clean, responsive UI built with Streamlit and enhanced with emojis and imagery.
* **Rain Animation** – Celebrate generosity with a raining blood drop animation using `streamlit_extras`.

* [Pymysql](https://pymysql.readthedocs.io/) – Python MySQL client.
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – For tabular data handling.
* [Geopy](https://pypi.org/project/geopy/) – Distance calculation (future use).
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) – KNN model integration (planned matching system).
* [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) – Image processing.
* [streamlit-extras](https://github.com/tylerjrichards/streamlit-extras) – For visual effects.
